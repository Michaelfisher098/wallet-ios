        You are going to export anonymous diagnostical data. It contains technical details of wallet operation, raw bitcoin transactions, balances and addresses.<br/><br/>
        No personal information is exported except for account labels. You can redact account labels beforehand if you prefer.
        <br/><br/>
        The data will not be sent automatically by this app: you are free to choose the email address or account from which to send this data (our email: <strong>support@mycelium.com</strong>).
        For better privacy it is recommended that you use one-time email address (use Tor if necessary).</br>
        <br/>
        Scroll down to begin export.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>What data is exported:</strong></br>
        </br>
        — logs containing error codes of internal operations</br>
        — raw bitcoin transactions and addresses</br>
        — account balances, xpub addresses and labels</br>
        — device model, iOS version, device capabilities</br>
        — various other anonymous technical data about wallet operation</br>
        </br>
        <strong>What data is NOT exported:</strong></br>
        </br>
        — App does not export personal information, and does not even have access to your unique device identifier (UDID), your contacts, location etc. </br>
        — App does not export private keys or master seed.</br>
        — App does not export device passcode or fingerprint data (these are not available to any app anyway).</br>
        </br>
        The exported data will be encrypted with Mycelium ECIES key,
        so you can safely send the data over email without the risk of surveillance.
        Only Mycelium developers will have access to the diagnostical data.<br/>
